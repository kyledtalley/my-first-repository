#Hello World, I love using git
Important steps for git workflow: 

1. Initialize repository with git init
2. Create changes to project files
3. Check status of those files with git status
4. Stage changes for commit
5. Commit changes to version history
6. Review previous changes with git log


git status : Run this command any time and often to chekc on status of the files in the git repository.

git add : This command stages changed files, readying them to be wrapped into the next commit

git commit : This command commits staged files, wrapping them into a commit. A historical record of commits is what we refer to as a codebase's version or commit history.

git log : View the repository's commit history
